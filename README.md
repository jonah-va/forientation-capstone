# Face Orientation Classifier - Capstone Project for General Assembly
The end goal of this project is to be able to accurately track where people are looking at in a room, using a standard video with the aid of neural networks. Using this the we can then track the locations that people are looking at, to analyse and create business solutions. An example of some use cases would be in a retail where the company can track which advertisements are being looked at so they can optimize these advertisements and also get a more accurate knowledge of what is influencing people. Another case is for placement of a product; the company can place their desired selling products in the most viewed locations, and even giving their suppliers different prices based on more precise location. These solutions will be able to save a lot of money and clear unknowns about the customers and their interests.
# Current Stage
The project is currently a simple facial oreintation classifier which can predict 5 different face angles down to a 92% accuracy. This is highly constrained to how the photo is taken and will need to be improved with more data. This stage was also a training ground for Neural Networks and learning about how they work and see the world.
